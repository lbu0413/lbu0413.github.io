<p>The <strong>Open Web Application Security Project, or OWASP</strong>, is an international non-profit organization dedicated to <strong>web application security</strong>. One of OWASP&rsquo;s core principles is that all of their materials be freely available and easily accessible on their website, making it possible for anyone to improve their own web application security.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-owasp-top-10">What is OWASP Top 10?</h3>
<p><strong>The OWASP Top 10</strong> is a regularly-updated report outlining security concerns for web application security, focusing on the 10 most critical risks.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Broken Access Control</li>
<li>Cryptographic Failures</li>
<li>Injection</li>
<li>Insecure Design</li>
<li>Security Misconfiguration</li>
<li>Vulnerable and Outdated Components</li>
<li>Identification and Authentication Failures</li>
<li>Software and Data Integrity Failures</li>
<li>Security Logging &amp; Monitoring Failures</li>
<li>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-broken-access-control">1. Broken Access Control</h3>
<p>Websites usually have pages that are protected from regular visitors. For example, only the site&rsquo;s admin user should be able to access a page to manage other users. If a website visitor can access protected pages they are not meant to see, then the access controls are <em>broken</em>.</p>
<h4 id="broken-access-control-idor-challenge">Broken Access Control (IDOR Challenge)</h4>
<p><strong>IDOR</strong> or <strong>Insecure Direct Object Reference</strong> refers to an access control vulnerability where you can access resources you wouldn&rsquo;t normally be able to see. This occurs when the programmer exposes a <strong>Direct Object Reference</strong>, which is just an identifier that refers to specific objects within the server. By object, it can refer to a file, a user, a bank account in a banking application, or anything.</p>

<p>Deploy the machine and go to <code>http://MACHINE_IP</code> - login with the username <em>noot</em> and the password <em>test1234</em>.</p>

Look at other user's notes. What is the flag?
